He found an early idol and used it as leverage, not a crutch. With 3 immunity wins and 4 total challenge wins, he always had a second path to safety when votes got messy, and he reached the end as the most complete résumé on paper.  The backbone of the run was an unbreakable link with Trent.In the finale, he fell just short—losing to Lindsay 5–4 after a season of control that never quite turned into a title (Result: runner-up; 2nd).\n\n────────\n\nSEASON 2 — Action\n────────\n\nSEASON 2 — Action\nAlejandro treated Season 2 on the Screaming Gaffers like a control puzzle: read the room, win when necessary, and keep danger pointed elsewhere. Ezekiel’s merge idol play protected him at the perfect moment and opened a runway into the endgame. He reached Final Tribal as the season’s most strategically-feared finalist, but finished runner-up to Duncan.\n\n────────\n\nSEASON 4 — Edge of Extinction\n────────\n\nSEASON 4 — Edge of Extinction\nReturning for Edge of Extinction (Season 4), Alejandro finally cashed in the crown after two straight runner-up finishes. Starting on Yellow → Red → Green → Campers, he navigated the swaps without losing his grip, then hit the endgame with back‑to‑back immunity wins (Episodes 7–8). His résumé was sealed at Final 4 with a fire‑making win over Gwen, and he survived the chaos of two public meltdowns (Episodes 10 and 14) long enough to reach Final Tribal Council. Result: Alejandro won Season 4.",

Her run wasn’t about immunity or idols—it was about surviving the social fallout of a tribe that kept trying to clean house—she even cracked the Mystery Box by finding its key, and she survived a Safety Without Power tribal when the vote was turning ugly.

He secured the Galang idol and used it the way winners do: not for fireworks, but for timing.

That single decision forced the game to reroute around them, bought Mickey the finale, and proved he was still playing one step ahead when it mattered most.

Their run became defined by trust: the unbreakable bond with Scott carried them deep, even as the endgame turned into betrayal roulette. At the final vote before the Final Tribal Council, Scott pulled the trigger and Zoey was cut in Episode 13 (Result: voted out 3–1; 4th, final juror).\n\n────────\n\nSEASON 4 — Edge of Extinction\n────────\n\nSEASON 4 — Edge of Extinction\nUNPRECEDENTED social dominance with 3 unbreakable bonds at once in S4. Lost 6-7 to Alejandro in closest finale ever. Most socially connected player in franchise history.\n\nOn Edge of Extinction (Season 4), Zoey delivered a near‑perfect social game. She built an unprecedented web of three “unbreakable bonds” at once, kept her name off the parchment all season (the only vote against her was cancelled), and capped the midgame with a perfect idol play that erased seven votes and saved Geoff. After a key Episode 8 flip and back‑to‑back immunities late (Episodes 11–12), she reached Final Tribal Council—but fell just short. Result: Zoey finished runner‑up.\n\n────────\n\nSEASON 7 — Unknown\n────────\n\nSEASON 7 — Unknown\nReturnee social stabilizer targeted in a numbers lock after a volatile swap.",
