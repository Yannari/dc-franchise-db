  "seasonNarrative": "Total Drama: Fans vs Favorites (Season 7) opened with a tone-setting winner first boot (Lindsay) and a pre-merge defined by swaps, an Exile extra vote (Pete), and Kitty quietly amassing two idols while Cody pocketed a Legacy Advantage. Lawa stabilized around a functional majority; Naale congealed late behind the Scott/Shawn duo. The 3-tribe swap and a joint Tribal produced chaos boots (Brody, Spud), while MacArthur found an idol and emerged as a stabilizing enforcer. At merge, Jasmine became the ‘peace offering’ leader cut. The season’s centerpiece was the Kitty arc: an all-time ‘idol firewall’ that erased eight votes on her and shielded Scott, sending Pete out instead—only for the tribe to finish Kitty the next round. From there, the game shifted into duo extermination: Shawn fell 5–4, then Scott 6–2, while Taylor’s hub power ended on a ricochet from Tom’s perfectly timed idol at seven. Sky’s removal at six confirmed a Carrie/Cody/MacArthur endgame machine. The F5 ‘advantage dump’ (Carrie’s Vote Steal + Cody/MacArthur idols) obliterated Tom. In the finale, Jacques won F4 immunity but imploded and quit, creating a Carrie–Cody–MacArthur Final 3. MacArthur’s cross-tribe bridges, idol discipline, and independent voting record earned a decisive 6–2–1 win over Cody and Carrie.",
