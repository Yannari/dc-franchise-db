## Project
DC Franchise Simulator — a Survivor-style franchise simulator.
ES modules, no build step. Open `simulator.html` in a browser.

## Architecture
- `simulator.html` — CSS + HTML shell (no JS, loads `js/main.js`)
- `js/main.js` — entry point, imports all modules, exposes on window for onclick handlers
- `js/core.js` — shared state (`gs`, `players`), constants, config, serialization
- `js/players.js` — `pStats`, `pronouns`, `romanticCompat`, threat utilities
- `js/bonds.js` — bond system + perceived bonds
- `js/alliances.js` — alliance formation, targeting, heat, betrayals
- `js/voting.js` — vote simulation, resolution, SITD
- `js/advantages.js` — advantage finding, idol/non-idol plays
- `js/romance.js` — full romance pipeline (sparks -> showmance -> breakup)
- `js/episode.js` — `simulateEpisode` orchestrator, player state, survival, popularity
- `js/camp-events.js` — camp events, social politics, mole, hero/villain
- `js/social-manipulation.js` — forge note, lies, kiss trap, whisper, rally
- `js/twists.js` — `applyTwist`, dock arrivals, first impressions, journey
- `js/rescue-island.js` — RI choice, duel, reentry, life events
- `js/finale.js` — finale simulation, jury vote, FTC, fan campaign
- `js/challenges-core.js` — `pickChallenge`, tribe/individual challenge dispatch
- `js/chal/*.js` — one file per challenge (simulate + rpBuild + _text)
- `js/text-backlog.js` — non-challenge text generation, summaries, storylines
- `js/aftermath.js` — aftermath show generation + VP
- `js/vp-screens.js` — `buildVPScreens`, non-challenge/non-finale rpBuild*
- `js/vp-finale.js` — finale rpBuild* screens
- `js/vp-ui.js` — VP navigation, reveals, particles, search
- `js/cast-ui.js` — cast builder, roster, presets, config, relationships UI
- `js/run-ui.js` — run tab, timeline, twist catalog, episode history
- `js/savestate.js` — save/load, snapshots, `patchEpisodeHistory`
- `franchise_roster.json` — player database (name, stats, archetype, slug)
- `assets/avatars/` — player portrait PNGs

### Module Pattern
- `core.js` exports mutable state with setter functions (`setGs()`, `setPlayers()`)
- `main.js` uses `Object.defineProperty` to expose state on `window` as getters/setters
- All exported functions are exposed on `window` for onclick handlers
- Modules import from each other; no circular dependencies
- `core.js` is a leaf — imports nothing from the project

## Non-Negotiable Rules

### Stats are ALWAYS Proportional
`stat * factor` — never `if (stat >= X)` for gameplay. Thresholds ONLY for narrative text selection.

### Archetype Access
`pStats(name)` = stats ONLY. `players.find(p => p.name === name)?.archetype` for archetype.

### Valid Archetypes
`mastermind`, `schemer`, `hothead`, `challenge-beast`, `social-butterfly`, `loyal-soldier`, `wildcard`, `chaos-agent`, `floater`, `underdog`, `hero`, `villain`, `goat`, `perceptive-player`, `showmancer`. Do NOT invent archetypes that don't exist (no `brainiac`, `nerd`, `protector`, `loyal`, `black-widow`).

### Archetype Behavior Rules
- **Villain archetypes** (villain, mastermind, schemer): can scheme, sabotage, steal, ambush, taunt
- **Nice archetypes** (hero, loyal-soldier, social-butterfly, showmancer, underdog, goat): NEVER scheme, sabotage, steal, or ambush. CAN encourage, guard, bond, help.
- **Neutral archetypes** (hothead, challenge-beast, wildcard, chaos-agent, floater, perceptive-player): can scheme/sabotage only with strategic >= 6 AND loyalty <= 4

### Pronouns
`pronouns(name)` → `{sub, obj, pos, posAdj, ref, Sub, Obj, PosAdj}`. `posAdj` before nouns, `pos` standalone. NO `Pos` property.

### Behavior > Stats
Check behavioral track record alongside raw stats.

### Every Feature Needs VP + Text Backlog
VP screens (`rpBuild*`) + text backlog. Neither optional. For twist challenges, prefer `_textTwistChallenge()` which renders VP screens as plain text automatically — no custom `_text` function needed. The text backlog must be a complete retranscription of the VP narration, placed BEFORE `_textCampPost` in `generateSummaryText()`.

### Camp Events Must Have Consequences
Bond/state/information changes. `players: []` array + `badgeText`/`badgeClass` required.

### ALL Social Events Must Have Consequences
Every social event inside a challenge — collisions, taunts, helps, steals, encouragement, trash talk, rivalry, banter — MUST have gameplay consequences (`addBond`, `popDelta`, camp event injection, or state changes). No event should be purely cosmetic text. If a player does something to another player, it must affect their relationship or reputation.

### SVG for Visual Elements — Never CSS Divs
When creating decorative or illustrative visuals (animals, objects, scenery, icons beyond simple geometric shapes), always use inline SVG. Never attempt to build images out of CSS div hacks — they produce unrecognizable shapes. SVG gives precise control over paths, curves, and proportions. CSS is for layout, styling, and simple geometric indicators (dots, bars, borders) only.

### Serialization
Functions don't survive `JSON.stringify`. Pre-render text as strings. Sets need `prepGsForSave()`/`repairGsSets()`.

### Popularity System
Every challenge event that's heroic, villainous, cowardly, or selfless must affect `gs.popularity[name]`. Pattern: `if (!gs.popularity) gs.popularity = {}; gs.popularity[name] = (gs.popularity[name] || 0) + delta;`

## Challenge Rules

### Required Per Challenge
- `updateChalRecord(ep)` with `ep.chalMemberScores`
- Debug challenge tab + VP screen + text backlog + cold open + timeline tag
- Badge text/class for all event types
- `patchEpisodeHistory` + all challenge twists mutually incompatible
- Skip main `updateChalRecord` (add to skip list)
- Showmance moments if challenge has downtime/partner interaction/danger
- Popularity changes for heroic/villain/coward moments
- `chalSeries` in TWIST_CATALOG entry — every challenge from a specific show MUST have an origin series (`'island'`, `'action'`, `'world-tour'`, `'revenge'`, `'all-stars'`, `'pahkitew'`, `'ridonculous'`, `'dc1'`–`'dc5'`). If a challenge is an original mechanic with no show origin, omit `chalSeries`.
- **World Tour challenges**: NEVER mention the real-world country name in narration, VP text, or challenge descriptions. Reference the setting indirectly (e.g. "ancient pyramids" not "Egypt", "neon-lit game show studio" not "Japan"). The simulator is its own universe — no real geography.
- `chalStyle` in TWIST_CATALOG entry — every challenge MUST have a style tag for the randomizer's category-aware pacing. Valid values: `'physical'`, `'endurance'`, `'hunt'`, `'social'`, `'puzzle'`, `'adventure'`, `'chaos'`. The randomizer avoids placing two consecutive episodes with the same style.
- Live-updating sidebar — every twist challenge VP MUST have an interactive sidebar that rebuilds on every reveal click. Sidebar must be gated by `_tvState` (never spoil ahead), show phase-specific data, and store phase data on `window` (not globals that get overwritten). Call the rebuild function from both `revealNext` AND `revealAll`.

### Scoring Balance
Tribe scores: averages per member, NEVER raw sums.

### VP Pattern
`_tvState[key]` with `idx: -1` for click-to-reveal. Save/restore scrollTop. When rebuilding VP screens from a reveal handler, preserve `vpCurrentScreen` by finding the screen index after `buildVPScreens`.

## Core State
- `gs` — global state. `gs.episodeHistory[]` for VP.
- `getBond(a,b)` / `addBond(a,b,delta)` — symmetric, -10 to +10
- `getPerceivedBond(a,b)` — for votes/alliances/heat decisions
- `gs.advantages[]`, `gs.namedAlliances[]`, `gs.showmances[]`, `gs.romanticSparks[]`
- `gs.popularity` — per-player popularity tracking, affects fan perception
- Temporary heat: `gs._emissaryHeat`, `gs._dodgebrawlHeat`, `gs._talentShowHeat`, `gs._suckyOutdoorsHeat`, `gs._upTheCreekHeat`, `gs._paintballHeat`, `gs._cookingHeat`, `gs._trustHeat` (`{ amount, expiresEp }`), `gs._basicStrainingHeat` (`{ target, amount, expiresEp }`), `gs._cliffDiveBlame`, `gs._luckyHuntHeat`, `gs._schemeHeat`, `gs._hideSeekHeat` (`{ target, amount, expiresEp }`), `gs._bikeRaceHeat` (`{ amount, expiresEp }`), `gs._monsterCashHeat` (`{ target, amount, expiresEp }`), `gs._rockTheDockHeat` (`{ amount, expiresEp }`)

## Scope Gotchas
- `ep` NOT available in: `generateCampEventsForGroup` (camp-events.js), `simulateIndividualChallenge`/`simulateTribeChallenge` (challenges-core.js), `computeHeat` (alliances.js)
- `ep.extraImmune` — always MERGE, never overwrite
- `applyTwist` (twists.js) fires BEFORE challenge — set flags there, run logic after
- Merge camp key: `gs.mergeName || 'merge'`
- `romanticCompat(a, b)` (players.js) — check before any romance/kiss events (real or fake)
- Module state mutations: use setter functions (`setGs()`, `setPlayers()`) from core.js, not direct assignment on imports
- Cross-module function calls: functions on `window` work as bare calls in module code; for explicit imports use `import { fn } from './module.js'`

Class advantages per beat. Princess gives sword+armor advantages, has 1 save. Top knight duels Princess for immunity. Happy ending possible (showmance/high bond = both get immunity). Storybook VP with phase-specific environments. |

### Both Phases
| ID | Name | Key Mechanic |
|---|---|---|
| `basic-straining` | Basic Straining | Pre: first tribe to zero loses. Post: last standing wins immunity. |
| `monster-cash` | Monster Cash | Monster movie hunt. Chef's animatronic prowls the film lot. Monster escalates through 5 threat levels (Awakening→Final Form). Capture events, rescues, sabotage. Pre-merge: tribe immunity by avg survival. Post-merge: last standing wins, normal tribal council follows. |

## Social Manipulation Camp Events (Standalone)
Fires in ANY episode (not tied to a challenge). Rate: ~15% per eligible schemer per episode, boosted to ~40% during Lucky Hunt.

**Schemer eligibility:** villain/mastermind/schemer archetypes always. Neutral archetypes need strategic >= 6 + loyalty <= 4. Nice archetypes NEVER scheme.

| Event | Mechanic |
|---|---|
| Forge Note | Schemer plants fake note. Belief check: noteQuality vs mental+intuition. 3 outcomes: believed/skeptical/detected. |
| Spread Lies | Face-to-face. Social persuasion vs resistance. Can trigger confrontation sub-event. |
| Kiss Trap | Rarest. Needs showmance + accomplice + romantic compatibility. Showmance destruction possible. |
| Whisper Campaign | Subtle. Seeds doubt with 5-6 individuals. Hard to trace. |
| Campaign Rally | Social player rallies votes against a target. Heat applied. |
| Expose Schemer | Reaction event. High-intuition player catches a scheme. Schemer takes massive heat. |
| Comfort Victim | Reaction event. Loyal player comforts scheme victim. Bond boost + potential alliance. |

## Returning Player Twist
Configurable 1-3 returnees per episode. Each slot has a "reason for returning" that drives selection weights:
- `random` — baseline strategic + noise
- `unfinished-business` — bond strength with active players, was blindsided
- `entertainment` — showmance involvement, social stat, boldness
- `strategic-threat` — strategic stat, alliance membership, enemy count
- `underdog` — eliminated early, low threat

UI: count dropdown (1-3) + per-slot reason dropdown in Episode Format Designer.

## Key Systems

### Romance
Toggle: `seasonConfig.romance`. Pipeline: spark → intensity → first move → showmance → love triangle → affair. `_challengeRomanceSpark()` for challenges. `_checkShowmanceChalMoment()` for existing showmances. Always check `romanticCompat(a, b)` before romance events — including fake/sabotage kisses.

**Max 2 active showmances per season.** `_challengeRomanceSpark()` in romance.js already enforces this cap internally. NEVER create sparks/showmances via inline `gs.romanticSparks.push()` or `gs.showmances.push()` in challenge files — always use `_challengeRomanceSpark()`. If a challenge truly needs inline spark logic, it MUST check: (1) `seasonConfig.romance` enabled, (2) `gs.showmances.filter(sh => !sh.broken).length < 2`, (3) neither player already in an active showmance, (4) `romanticCompat(a, b)`, (5) no existing spark between the pair.

### The Mole
Season twist. 5 sabotage types. Suspicion tracking. Exposure at 3.0.

### Social Politics
3-5 actions/ep: side deals, info trades, loyalty tests. Vote pitches at tribal. Social manipulation events (forge note, lies, kiss trap, etc.) fire based on cast composition.

## Collaboration Style
- Think independently — brainstorm and propose
- Always propose before implementing
- Camp events MUST have gameplay consequences
- Information from mechanics must flow into targeting
- Skip spec/plan for challenge designs — go straight from brainstorm to implementation

## How to Create a New Twist Challenge (Complete Guide)

### Step 1: File Creation
Create `js/chal/<challenge-id>.js`. Use an existing challenge (e.g., `super-hero-ld.js` or `princess-pride.js`) as a template. Standard imports:
```javascript
import { gs, players, seasonConfig } from '../core.js';
import { pStats, pronouns, updateChalRecord } from '../players.js';
import { addBond, getBond } from '../bonds.js';
import { _challengeRomanceSpark, _checkShowmanceChalMoment } from '../romance.js';
```

### Step 2: Integration Points (ALL required)
**5 files must be updated:**

1. **`js/core.js`** — Add TWIST_CATALOG entry:
   ```javascript
   { id:'challenge-id', emoji:'🎯', name:'Challenge Name', category:'challenge',
     chalSeries:'action', chalStyle:'adventure', phase:'post-merge',
     desc:'Description...', engineType:'challenge-id',
     incompatible:[...all other challenge IDs...] }
   ```

2. **`js/twists.js`** — Add `engineType` → flag mapping in `applyTwist()`:
   ```javascript
   } else if (engineType === 'challenge-id') {
     ep.isChallengeId = true;
   ```
   No merge/phase checks here — let episode.js handle that.

3. **`js/episode.js`** — SEVEN places to update:
   - **Import**: `import { simulateChallengeId } from './chal/challenge-id.js';`
   - **Dispatch block** (near other post-merge challenges ~line 1475):
     ```javascript
     if (ep.isChallengeId && gs.isMerged) {
       simulateChallengeId(ep);
       ep.immunityWinner = ep.challengeData?.immunityWinner || ep.immunityWinner;
       ep.challengeType = 'challenge-id';
     }
     ```
   - **Generic challenge skip** (~line 2221): add `|| ep.isChallengeId` to the `isMonsterCash || isOperationClassified || ...` condition
   - **Generic updateChalRecord guard** (~line 2545): add `&& !ep.isChallengeId` — prevents double-calling. The twist challenge's `simulate` function already calls `updateChalRecord(ep)` internally; this guard stops the GENERIC catch-all from calling it a second time (which would double-count wins/podiums/bombs).
   - **`_hasTwistChallenge` list** (~line 1640): add `|| ep.isChallengeId` — THIS IS CRITICAL for sudden-death compatibility. Without it, sudden death runs its own generic challenge instead of using the twist challenge results to eliminate last place.
   - **`handleExileFormat` guard** (~line 991): add `|| ep.isChallengeId` — prevents exile format from interfering with the twist challenge.
   - **Episode history save** — add `isChallengeId: ep.isChallengeId || false, challengeData: ep.challengeData || null` to ALL `gs.episodeHistory.push` calls in episode.js (there are 4+: main ~line 5400, no-tribal ~line 2918, sudden-death ~line 1715, sudden-death+twist ~line 2417). Missing any one = VP screens show nothing on replay for that episode type.

4. **`js/vp-screens.js`** — Add import + screen registration:
   ```javascript
   import { rpBuild..., revealNext, revealAll } from './chal/challenge-id.js';
   // In buildVPScreens(), add:
   } else if ((ep.isChallengeId || ep.challengeType === 'challenge-id') && ep.challengeData) {
     vpScreens.push({ id:'xx-title', label:'Title', html: rpBuildTitleCard(ep) });
     // ... more screens
   }
   ```

5. **`js/text-backlog.js`** — Two options for text backlog:

   **Option A (recommended): VP-rendered text backlog** — uses `_textTwistChallenge()` to call VP builder functions and strip HTML. This automatically outputs the exact narration from the VP screens with zero manual work:
   ```javascript
   // In text-backlog.js — import VP builders:
   import { rpBuildChallengeTitleCard, rpBuildChallengePhase1, ... } from './chal/challenge-id.js';
   // In generateSummaryText() — call generic renderer:
   if (ep.challengeData) {
     _textTwistChallenge(ep, ln, sec, 'challengeData', 'CHALLENGE NAME', [
       rpBuildChallengeTitleCard, rpBuildChallengePhase1, ...
     ]);
   }
   ```
   Place the call in the twist challenges block (BEFORE `_textCampPost`).

   **Option B: Custom `_text` function** — export `_textChallengeId(ep, ln, sec)` from the challenge file and call it manually. Use this only if you need a different format than the VP output. Must include ALL narration text from the VP — every player action, every event, every score. The text backlog should be a complete retranscription of what the VP shows.

6. **`js/main.js`** — Add `import * as challengeMod from './chal/challenge-id.js';` and add `challengeMod` to the module spread array.

7. **`js/run-ui.js`** — Add episode history badge tag (colored pill in episode timeline).

### Step 3: Simulation Structure
```javascript
export function simulateChallengeId(ep) {
  const active = gs.activePlayers.filter(p => p !== gs.exileDuelPlayer);
  const campKey = gs.mergeName || 'merge';
  if (!ep.campEvents) ep.campEvents = {};
  if (!ep.campEvents[campKey]) ep.campEvents[campKey] = { pre: [], post: [] };
  if (!ep.chalMemberScores) ep.chalMemberScores = {};
  active.forEach(n => { ep.chalMemberScores[n] = 0; });

  const result = { /* challenge data */ };

  // ... simulation logic ...

  // Romance hooks (pass null for phases/phaseKey to avoid push errors)
  const _romActive = gs.activePlayers.filter(p => p !== gs.exileDuelPlayer);
  for (let i = 0; i < _romActive.length; i++)
    for (let j = i + 1; j < _romActive.length; j++)
      _challengeRomanceSpark(_romActive[i], _romActive[j], ep, null, null, ep.chalMemberScores || {}, 'challenge context');
  _checkShowmanceChalMoment(ep, null, null, ep.chalMemberScores || {}, 'challenge', _romActive);

  // Finalize
  ep.challengeData = result;
  ep.isChallengeId = true;
  ep.challengeType = 'challenge-id';
  ep.challengeLabel = 'Challenge Name';
  ep.challengeCategory = 'mixed';
  ep.immunityWinner = result.immunityWinner;
  ep.chalPlacements = [...];
  // Immunity winner MUST be #1 in chalMemberScores
  const maxOther = Math.max(0, ...Object.entries(ep.chalMemberScores).filter(([n]) => n !== result.immunityWinner).map(([,s]) => s));
  ep.chalMemberScores[result.immunityWinner] = Math.max(ep.chalMemberScores[result.immunityWinner] || 0, maxOther) + active.length + 5;
  ep.tribalPlayers = active;
  updateChalRecord(ep);
  return ep;
}
```

### Step 3b: Pre-Merge vs Post-Merge vs Both-Phase Challenges

Every twist challenge must handle immunity and tribal assignment differently based on the game phase. The Step 3 template above shows the post-merge pattern. Below are the critical differences.

#### Post-Merge (Individual Immunity)
The winner gets personal immunity. Everyone else goes to tribal.
```javascript
ep.immunityWinner = result.immunityWinner;  // player name
ep.tribalPlayers = active;                  // everyone goes to tribal (immune player protected by episode.js)
// Immunity winner MUST be #1 in chalMemberScores — add massive bonus:
const maxOther = Math.max(0, ...Object.entries(ep.chalMemberScores).filter(([n]) => n !== result.immunityWinner).map(([,s]) => s));
ep.chalMemberScores[result.immunityWinner] = Math.max(ep.chalMemberScores[result.immunityWinner] || 0, maxOther) + active.length + 5;
```
- `updateChalRecord(ep)` reads `ep.immunityWinner` to credit 1W (individual win)
- episode.js dispatch: `if (ep.isChallengeId && gs.isMerged)`

#### Pre-Merge (Tribe Immunity)
The winning tribe gets immunity. Tribes are ranked by average member score — worst tribe goes to tribal, middle tribes are safe.
```javascript
// DO NOT set ep.immunityWinner — tribe wins, not an individual
// Rank tribes by average member score
const tribeRankings = tribeData.map(t => {
  const avg = t.members.map(n => ep.chalMemberScores[n] || 0).reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0) / (t.members.length || 1);
  return { tribeName: t.tribeName, avg, members: t.members };
});
tribeRankings.sort((a, b) => {
  if (a.tribeName === result.winningTribe) return -1;
  if (b.tribeName === result.winningTribe) return 1;
  return b.avg - a.avg;
});
const lastTribe = tribeRankings[tribeRankings.length - 1];

// Set ep fields for episode.js tribe challenge flow
ep.tribalPlayers = gs.tribes.find(t => t.tribeName === lastTribe.tribeName)?.members || active;
ep.winner = gs.tribes.find(t => t.tribeName === result.winningTribe);
ep.loser = gs.tribes.find(t => t.tribeName === lastTribe.tribeName);
ep.safeTribes = tribeRankings.slice(0, -1).map(t => gs.tribes.find(gt => gt.tribeName === t.tribeName)).filter(Boolean);
ep.challengePlacements = tribeRankings.map(t => gs.tribes.find(gt => gt.tribeName === t.tribeName)).filter(Boolean);
```
- `ep.tribalPlayers` = ONLY the losing tribe's members (not everyone)
- `ep.winner` / `ep.loser` = tribe objects from `gs.tribes` (NOT tribeData)
- `ep.safeTribes` = array of tribe objects for tribes that are safe
- `ep.challengePlacements` = all tribes in rank order
- VP results must explicitly show which tribe is safe vs which goes to tribal — don't just dump "Tribe A, Tribe B — tribal council awaits"
- episode.js dispatch: `if (ep.isChallengeId && !gs.isMerged)`
- Camp events use per-tribe keys (from `tribeData`), not `gs.mergeName`

#### Both-Phase Challenges
The challenge works in both phases but with different scoring and immunity logic. Branch on `gs.isMerged` inside the simulate function.
```javascript
export function simulateChallengeId(ep) {
  const active = gs.activePlayers.filter(p => p !== gs.exileDuelPlayer);

  if (gs.isMerged) {
    // POST-MERGE: individual immunity
    const campKey = gs.mergeName || 'merge';
    // ... individual scoring logic ...
    ep.immunityWinner = result.winner;
    ep.tribalPlayers = active;
    // massive chalMemberScores bonus for winner
  } else {
    // PRE-MERGE: tribe immunity
    const tribeData = gs.tribes.map(t => ({ tribeName: t.tribeName, members: t.members.filter(m => active.includes(m)) }));
    // ... tribe scoring logic ...
    // DO NOT set ep.immunityWinner
    // Set ep.winner, ep.loser, ep.safeTribes, ep.tribalPlayers (losing tribe only)
  }

  ep.challengeData = result;
  updateChalRecord(ep);
  return ep;
}
```
- episode.js dispatch: `if (ep.isChallengeId)` — no `gs.isMerged` check (fires in both phases)
- TWIST_CATALOG entry: `phase: 'both'` (not `'pre-merge'` or `'post-merge'`)
- VP results screen must branch on `gs.isMerged` to show tribe placements vs individual winner
- Pre-merge: tribe scores = averages per member, NEVER raw sums
- The simulate function handles both paths; episode.js doesn't need separate dispatch blocks

### Step 4: VP Pattern
- Each screen is an exported function: `rpBuildChallengeTitleCard(ep)`, `rpBuildChallengePhase1(ep)`, etc.
- Use `_tvState[stateKey]` with `idx: -1` for click-to-reveal
- Export `challengeRevealNext(screenKey, totalSteps)` and `challengeRevealAll(screenKey, totalSteps)`
- Shell wrapper function with CSS + theme: `_shellWrapper(content, ep, theme)`
- Sidebar should NOT spoil future results — show state from BEFORE current phase, update progressively
- Each screen needs its own `stateKey` for independent reveal state

#### VP Reveal: DOM-Only Updates (CRITICAL)
**NEVER rebuild the entire page on reveal click.** Calling `buildVPScreens()` + `renderVPScreen()` from a reveal handler destroys and recreates the entire DOM, causing the page to flash from top to bottom (nauseating scroll). Instead, use direct DOM manipulation:

**Required reveal pattern** (see `crazy-fun-time.js` as latest reference):
```javascript
// Re-applies visibility to ALL steps 0..upToIdx — patches stale DOM after screen switch
function _reapplyVisibility(suffix, upToIdx, total) {
  for (let i = 0; i <= upToIdx; i++) {
    const el = document.getElementById(`prefix-step-${suffix}-${i}`);
    if (el) el.classList.add('prefix-visible');
  }
  const counter = document.getElementById(`prefix-counter-${suffix}`);
  if (counter) counter.textContent = `${Math.min(upToIdx + 1, total)} / ${total}`;
  if (upToIdx >= total - 1) {
    const controls = document.getElementById(`prefix-controls-${suffix}`);
    if (controls) { const btns = controls.querySelectorAll('.prefix-btn'); btns.forEach(b => b.style.opacity = '0.4'); }
  }
}

export function challengeRevealNext(screenKey, totalSteps) {
  const st = _ensureState(screenKey, totalSteps);
  if (st.idx >= st.total - 1) return;
  st.idx++;
  const suffix = screenKey.replace('prefix-', '');
  _reapplyVisibility(suffix, st.idx, st.total); // patches stale DOM from screen switch
  const el = document.getElementById(`prefix-step-${suffix}-${st.idx}`);
  if (el) el.scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth', block: 'center' });
  _updateSidebar(screenKey);
}
```

**Required element IDs** (set during VP build):
- Each step div: `id="prefix-step-{suffix}-{i}"` (suffix = screenKey minus the `prefix-` part)
- Counter span: `id="prefix-counter-{suffix}"`
- Controls container: `id="prefix-controls-{suffix}"`
- Sidebar inner: `id="prefix-sidebar-inner"` (single element, innerHTML replaced on update)

**Auto-scroll**: `scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth', block: 'center' })` on the newly revealed element — page stays in place, new card slides into view.

**Sidebar live-update**: Split `_buildSidebar()` into wrapper (has the `id`) and `_buildSidebarContent()` (returns inner HTML). The `_updateSidebar()` function finds the sidebar element by ID and replaces only its innerHTML — no full page rebuild.

#### VP Mockup Workflow
1. **Create a standalone mockup HTML file** (`mockup-<name>.html`) with all CSS, layout, icons, fonts, and placeholder data. This is the visual target.
2. **Get user approval** on the mockup before writing any VP builder code.
3. **VP builders must reproduce the mockup exactly** — same grid layout, same fonts, same CSS icon system, same sidebar structure, same card physics, same ambient effects. If the VP output doesn't match the mockup, it's wrong.
4. **After VP builders are written, verify against the mockup** — open both in a browser and compare. The mockup is the source of truth.
5. **Keep the mockup file** in the repo for future reference — it documents the visual intent.

### Step 5: Scoring Rules
- `chalMemberScores` accumulates across all phases — used for challenge tab ranking
- Immunity winner gets massive bonus to guarantee #1 position
- Survivors/top performers get intermediate bonuses
- `chalPlacements` array: best-to-worst order for podium/bomb tracking
- `updateChalRecord(ep)` reads `ep.immunityWinner` to credit the win (1W)

### Step 6: Common Bugs to Avoid
- **Episode history not saving challenge data**: MUST add `challengeData: ep.challengeData || null` to the episode history object in `episode.js` (~line 5400) or VP screens show nothing on replay
- **Romance hook crash**: pass `null` for `phases` and `phaseKey` params to `_challengeRomanceSpark` and `_checkShowmanceChalMoment` — they try to push to `phases[phaseKey]` array which doesn't exist
- **Immunity winner not #1 in scores**: add massive bonus AFTER all other scoring
- **Pre-merge challenges must NOT set `ep.immunityWinner`**: Pre-merge challenges are tribe challenges — the tribe wins immunity, not an individual. Setting `ep.immunityWinner` to a player name causes `updateChalRecord` to credit that player with 1W (individual win), which is wrong. Use the massive `chalMemberScores` bonus for podium placement only. Only post-merge (individual immunity) challenges should set `ep.immunityWinner`.
- **Generic challenge overwriting results**: must add to BOTH skip conditions in episode.js (generic challenge dispatch + updateChalRecord)
- **VP sidebar spoiling results**: build sidebar from state BEFORE current phase, not after
- **Camp events spoiling VP reveals**: don't push "X was crowned/eliminated" camp events that appear in Cold Open before the challenge VP screens
- **Same text repetition**: have 4+ text options per narration category minimum
- **Class/type assignment clustering**: use priority draft + cap system to ensure diversity
- **No-tribal / sudden-death missing challenge data in history**: episode.js has MULTIPLE early-return history pushes (no-tribal ~line 2918, sudden-death ~line 1715, sudden-death+twist ~line 2417, off-the-chain+SD ~line 2140). ALL of these must include the twist challenge data fields (`isHouston`, `houston`, `isTopDog`, `topDog`, etc.) or VP screens show nothing on replay. When adding a new twist challenge, grep for ALL `gs.episodeHistory.push` calls and add the new fields to every one.
- **Reveal handler rebuilding entire page**: NEVER call `buildVPScreens()`/`renderVPScreen()` from reveal handlers — this destroys the DOM and causes nauseating top-to-bottom page flash. Toggle individual step elements by ID + update sidebar innerHTML instead. See Step 4 for the correct pattern.
- **Tribe data property name**: Tribe objects use `tribeName` (NOT `name`). Using `tribe.name` gives `undefined`.
- **Episode number**: Current episode number is `gs.episodeHistory.length` (NOT `gs.episodeHistory.length + 1` — the current episode is already pushed). Don't use `ep.episodeNum` which doesn't exist.
- **buildVPScreens called without argument**: `buildVPScreens(epRecord)` requires the episode record argument. Calling it without args crashes with "epRecord is undefined".
- **TWIST_CATALOG description too long**: Keep `desc` field under ~200 characters or the challenge card in the UI will be much taller than others.
- **VP output doesn't match mockup**: Always compare the actual VP output against the approved mockup HTML file. Subagents building VP code must reproduce the mockup's exact layout, fonts, icons, sidebar, and card physics — not invent their own.
- **Reveals break after screen switch**: VP screens are cached HTML strings. Navigating away and back re-inserts stale HTML with all steps hidden, but `_tvState.idx` is still advanced. Fix: every `revealNext`/`revealAll` must call `_reapplyVisibility()` which loops from step 0 to current idx and adds the visible class to ALL steps. This patches the stale DOM. Without this, reveals silently fail after any screen navigation.
- **Reveal handlers must isolate sidebar/map updates**: Wrap sidebar and map update calls in separate try-catch blocks so that if `_updateSidebar()` or `_updateMap()` throws (e.g., missing `window` data after screen switch), it does NOT prevent `_reapplyVisibility()` from running. Always run `_reapplyVisibility()` FIRST (in its own try-catch), then sidebar/map updates. Pattern: `try { reapply } catch(e){} try { sidebar } catch(e){} try { map } catch(e){}`.
- **Reward Twist Challenge compatibility**: When adding a new twist challenge, you must do TWO things: (1) Add its ID to the `reward-twist-challenge` entry's `incompatible` list in `core.js` (prevents selecting both as separate twists in the same episode). (2) Add its engine ID and flag to the `_engineFlagMap` in `twists.js` inside the `reward-twist-challenge` handler (e.g., `'rock-the-dock': 'isRockTheDock'`). Without step 2, selecting the challenge as a reward engine shows a generic immunity challenge instead.
- **VP atmosphere covering VP nav bar**: Challenge atmosphere layers using `position:fixed;inset:0` will cover the VP player's top navigation bar (which has the close button). Fix: use `top:46px` instead of `top:0` on the atmosphere container so it doesn't overlap the 46px-tall `.rp-nav` bar.

### Step 7: VP Aesthetic Identity — OVERDRIVE IS THE BASELINE
Every challenge VP must feel like a standalone immersive experience with its own **unique visual identity**. The goal is wow factor — the user should feel transported into the challenge's world. Never settle for plain cards with emoji icons on a flat background.

**EVERY CHALLENGE IS DIFFERENT.** Do NOT copy another challenge's visual language. A pyramid expedition should not look like a space station. A fairy tale quest should not look like a spy thriller. Study the challenge's theme and invent visual primitives that belong to THAT world. No two challenges should share layout patterns, ambient effects, or HUD styles.

**Required foundations (adapt the form to the theme):**
- Unique CSS class prefix per challenge (e.g., `sh-` for Super Hero-ld, `eg-` for Walk Like an Egyptian)
- Unique font family + color palette — at least 2 fonts (display + body)
- `max-width:1100px;margin:0 auto` on the shell — never full-screen
- Phase-specific background themes that shift atmosphere (color temperature, mood)
- `@media(prefers-reduced-motion:reduce)` fallback on ALL animations
- CSS-only animated icons (no emoji) via `_icon(type)` helper — each challenge invents its own icon set
- Persistent background animations fitting the theme (particles, environmental effects)
- Phase-specific card physics — cards MOVE differently per zone
- Atmospheric flavor text between cards (comm chatter, announcer, ambient narration) — 8-10 per zone
- Sticky reveal controls (`position:fixed;bottom:0`) with counter (by ID for live update) + auto-scroll via `scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth', block: 'center' })` — page must stay in place, never flash top-to-bottom
- Interactive sidebar: live-updating on every reveal via DOM innerHTML replacement (by ID), zone-specific, gated by `_tvState`. Use `stepMeta` arrays for progressive score accumulation.
- Store phase data on `window`, read from DOM `data-phase` (not globals that get overwritten)

**Noise & Unpredictability (simulation, not VP):**
- All stat checks use `noise(2.5)` minimum — outcomes should surprise
- Never guarantee results from stats alone — upsets must happen regularly
- Elimination thresholds should let ~20-30% of players fail naturally

## Twist Challenge Design Rules (Learned from Get a Clue, Rock n' Rule, Way of the Warrior)

### Scoring Balance
- All phases should score in similar ranges (10-15 max per phase). One phase dominating = one player dominates.
- Don't use the same stat in every phase — spread stat requirements so different archetypes shine in different phases.
- No immunity score inflation (`maxOther + active.length + 5`) for challenges where the winner is already the highest scorer.
- Phase advantages (VIP, backstage pass) should give a meaningful edge but NOT guarantee the win.

### Sidebar / Honor Board — LIVE UPDATING (CRITICAL)
- **Must live-update on every reveal click** — call `_updateSidebar(screenKey)` from BOTH `revealNext` AND `revealAll`. The sidebar innerHTML is replaced in-place (by ID), NOT via full page rebuild.
- **Split sidebar into wrapper + content**: `_buildSidebar(ep, phase)` returns the outer `<div>` with `id="prefix-sidebar-inner"`. `_buildSidebarContent(ep, phase)` returns just the inner HTML. The update function calls `_buildSidebarContent()` and sets `sideEl.innerHTML`.
- **Running score accumulation via stepMeta**: For phases with progressive scores (pinball, fights, etc.), build a `stepMeta` array during VP build that tracks per-step scoring data (`{tribe, points, hits, zones}`). Store on `window` (e.g., `window._cftPinballStepMeta`). Sidebar reads `_tvState[key].idx` and accumulates scores only up to that index — scores build up progressively as cards are revealed.
- Store phase data on `window` via the shell wrapper, read phase from DOM `data-phase` attribute (not global variable — globals get overwritten when multiple screens pre-build).
- Show different data per phase (e.g., fight wins in fight phase, water levels in climb phase).
- **Gate ALL data by reveal index** — never spoil results before the corresponding card is revealed. Scores, zone breakdowns, event lists — everything must be gated by `_tvState[key].idx`.
- The initial `_buildSidebarContent` render must also read `_tvState` and gate data (not just the update path).
- **Episode data access**: Use `gs.episodeHistory[window.vpEpNum - 1]` to get the current episode record for sidebar updates.

### VP Narration Quality
- Minimum 4 text variants per narration category to avoid repetition.
- Text must be archetype-driven — a villain, hero, and goat should react differently to the same event.
- Every narration should reference the SPECIFIC player, their personality, and what happened — no generic "Player did well."
- Use `pick()` with large pools, or `_pickUnique()` to prevent duplicate text in the same game.
- Player cards inside manila/parchment folders need `color:var(--coffee)` or `rgba(26,26,26,0.8)` — light text on light backgrounds is INVISIBLE.

### Social Events Between Beats
- Fire social events BETWEEN each beat/round/phase, not just at the end.
- Guarantee at least 1 social event per beat — use probability for bonus events, not for the base event.
- Social event types: showmance, rivalry, bond, respect, blame, paranoia — each with distinct visual card.
- Social cards need player portrait icons (hanko/polaroid) and visually distinct styling from regular cards (dashed border, different background).
- Social events must have gameplay consequences (`addBond`, `popDelta`, camp events).

### Phase-Specific Environments
- Each phase needs its own distinct background/atmosphere — not the same background for all phases.
- Use the `_shell` wrapper's `phaseCls` parameter to set CSS class per phase.
- Environments should shift in color temperature: warm (training) → intense (fight) → cold/outdoor (climb).

### Fight / Competition Mechanics
- Round-robin for 3 players, bracket for 4+. Never leave someone with a bye in small groups.
- Show both fighter AND trainer in VS cards and KO cards — they win as a PAIR.
- Fight exchanges need: move icon + name + damage number + narration + HP bars for BOTH fighters.
- Each fight should generate 2-4 social events (trainer pride, respect, showmance comfort, blame).

### Climb / Endurance Mechanics
- Water loss formula must be tested at scale — `* 100` is death, `* 20-25` is reasonable.
- Players eliminated mid-stage should get elimination text, not just disappear next stage.
- If a boss fight at the summit results in a prize (bonsai), only ONE player grabs it first. Others who pass the boss can chase.
- Descent/steal mechanics: only players who passed the boss can intercept. Failed boss = no chase.

### VP Reveal System
- `<script>` tags in innerHTML don't execute — set `window` data directly in the VP build function.
- Use CSS classes (`step-hidden`/`step-visible`) toggled via `classList.add()` — NOT `display:none`/`display:block` via full page rebuild.
- **NEVER call `buildVPScreens()` or `renderVPScreen()` from reveal handlers** — this destroys the entire DOM and causes a nauseating top-to-bottom page flash. Toggle individual step elements by ID instead.
- **Each step div needs an ID**: `id="prefix-step-{suffix}-{i}"` so reveal handlers can find them directly.
- **Auto-scroll on reveal**: `el.scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth', block: 'center' })` — the page stays exactly where it is, new card slides smoothly into view. Never scroll to top.

#### Stale DOM After Screen Switch (CRITICAL — recurring bug)
**Problem:** VP screens are pre-built as HTML strings by `buildVPScreens()` and cached in an array. `renderVPScreen()` re-inserts this cached HTML on every screen navigation. So if the user reveals 5 cards (mutating the live DOM), navigates to another screen, then navigates back — the stale cached HTML is re-inserted with all steps hidden. But `_tvState.idx` is still at 4, so clicking reveal tries to show step 5 while steps 0-4 are invisible.

**Fix:** Every `revealNext`/`revealAll` must call a `_reapplyVisibility(suffix, upToIdx, total)` helper that loops from step 0 through the current index and adds the visible class to ALL of them. This patches the stale DOM on every click:
```javascript
function _reapplyVisibility(suffix, upToIdx, total) {
  for (let i = 0; i <= upToIdx; i++) {
    const el = document.getElementById(`prefix-step-${suffix}-${i}`);
    if (el) el.classList.add('prefix-visible');
  }
  // Also update counter text and dim buttons if done
}
```
This is idempotent — adding a class that already exists is a no-op. The cost is trivial (a few DOM lookups per click). Without this, reveals break after ANY screen switch.
- Fight exchanges should trigger impact animations (screen shake, move burst, KO slam).
- Betrayal/steal events should trigger screen shake on the entire shell.

### Integration Checklist (7 files)
Every twist challenge must update ALL of these:
1. `core.js` — TWIST_CATALOG entry with incompatible list
2. `twists.js` — `ep.isChallengeName = true` flag
3. `episode.js` — import, dispatch block, generic challenge skip, generic updateChalRecord guard (prevent double-call), `_hasTwistChallenge` list, `handleExileFormat` guard, ALL episode history pushes (4+ locations) (7+ edits)
4. `vp-screens.js` — import VP builders + screen registration
5. `text-backlog.js` — import + `_textTwistChallenge()` call with VP builders (placed BEFORE `_textCampPost`)
6. `main.js` — import module + add to spread array
7. `run-ui.js` — badge tag + add to tag display line

### Multi-Phase Race Challenges
Challenges with timed races across multiple phases (e.g., Broadway Baby's climb → sewer → park dash) have unique pitfalls:

**Time spread — avoid photo finishes:**
- Penalties must be large enough to create real separation. If success adds +1.0 and failure adds +1.5, the spread over 6 segments is ~3s — every race is a tie.
- Target: best-to-worst tribe spread of 10-20s. Below 10s feels artificially close. Above 25s feels like a blowout.
- Use a **momentum system** to compound advantages: `momFactor = 1.0 + momentum * 0.1` (cap momentum at ±2). Struggling tribes fall further behind, leading tribes pull ahead.
- Base penalties should be 2x-4x the success time, not 1.2x. A wrong turn should HURT.

**Phase-isolated scoring:**
- Each phase must track its own performance separately. Snapshot `tribe.time` before each phase starts (`t._prePhaseTime = t.time`) and compute phase-only time as `t.time - t._prePhaseTime`.
- Phase winners are determined by phase-only time, NOT cumulative time from all previous phases. Otherwise the Phase 1 winner always wins Phase 2.
- Cumulative time can still feed into overall final results.

**Live map updates — every phase needs one:**
- Every phase with a visual map MUST have a `_update[Phase]Map(screenKey)` function.
- All phase map updaters must be hooked into a unified `_updateMap(screenKey)` caller, wrapped in try-catch.
- Map markers need **tribe labels** (initials) and **vertical stagger** (`bottom: baseY + idx * offset`) so overlapping markers are distinguishable.
- Markers must have IDs (`id="prefix-marker-${tribeName}"`) for DOM-based live updates.
- Markers start at the ENTRY position, not at their final simulated position.

**Event frequency — avoid spam:**
- Routine success events (e.g., "Good Nav") should only emit cards ~35% of the time. Failures always emit.
- Have 6-8 text variants minimum for any event that can fire every segment.
- Guaranteed-every-segment events flood the timeline and make every tribe's log look identical.

**No duplicate event arrays:**
- Events belong in ONE array (e.g., `segmentData.events`). Do NOT also push them to a parallel array (e.g., `gatorEvents`) if the VP builder flattens both — this causes double rendering.
- If a secondary array exists for metadata tracking, the VP builder must flatten from only ONE source.
