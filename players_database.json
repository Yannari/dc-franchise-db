With 3 immunity wins and 4 total challenge wins, he always had a second path to safety when votes got messy, and he reached the end as the most complete r\u00e9sum\u00e9 on paper.  The backbone of the run was an unbreakable link with Trent.In the finale, he fell just short\u2014losing to Lindsay 5\u20134 after a season of control that never quite turned into a title (Result: runner-up; 2nd).\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\nSEASON 2 \u2014 Action\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\nSEASON 2 \u2014 Action\nAlejandro treated Season 2 on the Screaming Gaffers like a control puzzle: read the room, win when necessary, and keep danger pointed elsewhere.

He reached Final Tribal as the season\u2019s most strategically-feared finalist, but finished runner-up to Duncan.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\nSEASON 4 \u2014 Edge of Extinction\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\nSEASON 4 \u2014 Edge of Extinction\nReturning for Edge of Extinction (Season 4), Alejandro finally cashed in the crown after two straight runner-up finishes.

His r\u00e9sum\u00e9 was sealed at Final 4 with a fire\u2011making win over Gwen, and he survived the chaos of two public meltdowns (Episodes 10 and 14) long enough to reach Final Tribal Council.

While louder duos burned trust and idols, he stayed \u2018useful\u2019\u2014competent in challenges, calm in camp, and quietly steering the merge vote map by weaponizing other people\u2019s feuds. He survived the season\u2019s chaos points (tribe re-draw, Redemption returns, rock-draw fallout) and arrived at the end with the cleanest r\u00e9sum\u00e9 left. In the finale, the jury didn\u2019t debate\u2014they crowned him in a 7\u20131\u20130 landslide.

He stacked wins early and often (season-best 6 total challenge wins, including 5 immunities), while locking an unbreakable strategic duo with Taylor that shaped the merge vote map. Even when he wasn\u2019t beloved, he was unavoidable: he kept collecting allies through the numbers game and used immunity streaks to force everyone else to cannibalize instead. But the deeper the game went, the more personal it became, especially his escalating feud with Carrie that eventually hit extreme hatred. At Final 4, a meltdown wiped out the last stretch of his endgame, and he quit the game outright\u2014turning what looked like a potential winner run into the season\u2019s most dramatic collapse.",

Her war with Shawn escalated into extreme hatred on both sides, making every vote feel like a countdown to a blow-up.

He used that duo as a shield and a weapon, pushing targets like Devin and Kitty while refusing to let the vote splinter his side. Even when Kitty played an idol on him during the massive Episode 9 blow-up, Scott benefited from the protection without having to expose any advantage himself. The problem was the same thing that made him powerful also made him obvious: once the merge groups aligned, the entire board finally agreed he was the safest \u2018big threat\u2019 to remove. Scott left in 8th place after a near-unanimous pile-on, proving his duo was feared right up until it was dismantled.",
