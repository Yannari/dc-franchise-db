Early chaos, a critical swap idol play by Kelly, and a rock-draw merge shaped a volatile midgame where Mickey’s loyal core and Jacques’ surgical precision battled for control. In the end, Jacques combined low threat with perfect endgame execution, winning 7–1–0 after orchestrating advantages, immunities, and the Final 4 tie that sealed his path.",
