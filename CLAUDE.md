## Project
DC Franchise Simulator — a Survivor-style franchise simulator.
Single file: `simulator.html` (~76,000+ lines). Do not split.

## Architecture
- `simulator.html` — CSS + engine in one file
- `franchise_roster.json` — player database (name, stats, archetype, slug)
- `assets/avatars/` — player portrait PNGs

## Non-Negotiable Rules

### Stats are ALWAYS Proportional
`stat * factor` — never `if (stat >= X)` for gameplay. Thresholds ONLY for narrative text selection.

### Archetype Access
`pStats(name)` = stats ONLY. `players.find(p => p.name === name)?.archetype` for archetype.

### Pronouns
`pronouns(name)` → `{sub, obj, pos, posAdj, ref, Sub, Obj, PosAdj}`. `posAdj` before nouns, `pos` standalone. NO `Pos` property.

### Behavior > Stats
Check behavioral track record alongside raw stats.

### Every Feature Needs VP + Text Backlog
VP screens (`rpBuild*`) + text backlog (`_text*`). Neither optional.

### Camp Events Must Have Consequences
Bond/state/information changes. `players: []` array + `badgeText`/`badgeClass` required.

### Serialization
Functions don't survive `JSON.stringify`. Pre-render text as strings. Sets need `prepGsForSave()`/`repairGsSets()`.

## Challenge Rules

### Required Per Challenge
- `updateChalRecord(ep)` with `ep.chalMemberScores`
- Debug challenge tab + VP screen + text backlog + cold open + timeline tag
- Badge text/class for all event types
- `patchEpisodeHistory` + all challenge twists mutually incompatible
- Skip main `updateChalRecord` (add to skip list)
- Showmance moments if challenge has downtime/partner interaction/danger

### Scoring Balance
Tribe scores: averages per member, NEVER raw sums.

### VP Pattern
`_tvState[key]` with `idx: -1` for click-to-reveal. Save/restore scrollTop.

## Core State
- `gs` — global state. `gs.episodeHistory[]` for VP.
- `getBond(a,b)` / `addBond(a,b,delta)` — symmetric, -10 to +10
- `getPerceivedBond(a,b)` — for votes/alliances/heat decisions
- `gs.advantages[]`, `gs.namedAlliances[]`, `gs.showmances[]`, `gs.romanticSparks[]`
- Temporary heat: `gs._emissaryHeat`, `gs._dodgebrawlHeat`, `gs._talentShowHeat`, `gs._suckyOutdoorsHeat`, `gs._upTheCreekHeat`, `gs._paintballHeat`, `gs._cookingHeat`, `gs._trustHeat` (`{ amount, expiresEp }`), `gs._basicStrainingHeat` (`{ target, amount, expiresEp }`)

## Scope Gotchas
- `ep` NOT available in: `generateCampEventsForGroup`, `simulateIndividualChallenge`, `simulateTribeChallenge`, `computeHeat`
- `ep.extraImmune` — always MERGE, never overwrite
- `applyTwist` fires BEFORE challenge — set flags there, run logic after
- Merge camp key: `gs.mergeName || 'merge'`

## Challenge Twists

### Pre-Merge
| ID | Name | Key Mechanic |
|---|---|---|
| `phobia-factor` | Phobia Factor | Fear completion %, clutch triple points |
| `cliff-dive` | Cliff Dive | 3-phase: jump/haul/build, chicken blame |
| `awake-a-thon` | Awake-A-Thon | 3-phase: run/feast/awake, sequential dropout |
| `dodgebrawl` | Dodgebrawl | Multi-round dodgeball, per-player elimination |
| `talent-show` | Talent Show | Auditions → backstage → show, Chef-O-Meter |
| `sucky-outdoors` | Sucky Outdoors | 5-phase overnight survival |
| `up-the-creek` | Up the Creek | 4-phase canoe race, partner chemistry |
| `paintball-hunt` | Paintball Hunt | Hunter/deer split, round elimination |
| `hells-kitchen` | Hell's Kitchen | 3-course cooking, sabotage, food fights |
| `trust-challenge` | Who Can You Trust? | 3-round pair trust, narrative arc per round |
| `basic-straining` | Basic Straining | 6-phase boot camp, defiance, food raid, boathouse elimination |
| `x-treme-torture` | X-Treme Torture | 3 extreme sport events (skydiving, moose rodeo, mud skiing). One player per tribe per event. |

### Post-Merge
| ID | Name | Key Mechanic |
|---|---|---|
| `say-uncle` | Say Uncle | 4-phase Dungeon of Misfortune: Wheel→Gauntlet→Rack→Final Sentence. Pillory spectators, showmance moments, host commentary. Dominator pick + backfire. |
| `brunch-of-disgustingness` | Brunch of Disgustingness | Boys vs girls merge split. Cabin dynamics (7-8 events/team). 9-course eating: refusals, pressure-to-eat, chain vomit. Eat-off tiebreaker. Winning team immunity. |
| `triple-dog-dare` | Triple Dog Dare | Sudden death, freebie economy |
| `sudden-death` | Sudden Death | Last place auto-eliminated |
| `slasher-night` | Slasher Night | Round-by-round hunt, lowest eliminated |

### Both Phases
| ID | Name | Key Mechanic |
|---|---|---|
| `basic-straining` | Basic Straining | Pre: first tribe to zero loses. Post: last standing wins immunity. |

## Returning Player Twist
Configurable 1-3 returnees per episode. Each slot has a "reason for returning" that drives selection weights:
- `random` — baseline strategic + noise
- `unfinished-business` — bond strength with active players, was blindsided
- `entertainment` — showmance involvement, social stat, boldness
- `strategic-threat` — strategic stat, alliance membership, enemy count
- `underdog` — eliminated early, low threat

UI: count dropdown (1-3) + per-slot reason dropdown in Episode Format Designer.

## Key Systems

### Romance
Toggle: `seasonConfig.romance`. Pipeline: spark → intensity → first move → showmance → love triangle → affair. `_challengeRomanceSpark()` for challenges. `_checkShowmanceChalMoment()` for existing showmances.

### The Mole
Season twist. 5 sabotage types. Suspicion tracking. Exposure at 3.0.

### Social Politics
3-5 actions/ep: side deals, info trades, loyalty tests. Vote pitches at tribal.

## Collaboration Style
- Think independently — brainstorm and propose
- Always propose before implementing
- Camp events MUST have gameplay consequences
- Information from mechanics must flow into targeting
