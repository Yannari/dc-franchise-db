    "season2": "Brought back 14 returnees for intense warfare. Duncan's survival story beat Alejandro's immunity dominance (5 wins!). The season proved strategy alone doesn't guarantee victory - the jury wanted blood and struggle.",
    "season3": "Introduced Gen 2 with 16 new players. Emma's perfect game (0 votes until F4) won in a tiebreaker. Scott's 6 challenge wins couldn't overcome Emma's loyalty strategy.",
    "season4": "Combined All-Stars (9 Gen 1, 9 Gen 2) with Edge of Extinction. Alejandro FINALLY won his crown on his 3rd finals appearance, defeating Zoey's unprecedented 3 unbreakable bonds with strategic mastery. The closest finale ever (7-6-1) proved that in modern gameplay, strategy defeats pure social bonds.",
    "season5": "Introduced 18 new players and a Survivor-style twist gauntlet (3 tribes, swap, split-tribal merge round, vote-loss twists, and Final 4 fire-making). Mickey won with 0 votes against and survived a 3–3–2 FTC tie thanks to Ryan's deciding tiebreak vote — proving that clean positioning and relationships can beat pure challenge dominance.",
    "message": "The message across 5 seasons: Different strategies can win, but adaptability and respect from the jury are essential. Alejandro needed 3 tries to learn this lesson."
