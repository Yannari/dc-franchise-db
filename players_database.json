      "story": "On Cullhouse (Season 1), Alejandro became the strategic centerpiece on the Screaming Gophers, carving out a run defined by specific turning points rather than quiet coasting. Season stamp: PLAYER OF THE SEASON / MASTER STRATEGIST. Numbers back it up: 4 challenge wins (3 immunities), 1 idol find, 5 votes against. Their most defining relationship was the unbreakable bond with Trent, which kept reshaping the vote map whenever the game got messy. They reached Final Tribal Council as a clear endgame threat—but the crown slipped by a single vote. (Result: Alejandro lost 5–4.) Later appearances: Seasons 2, 4.\n\nAlejandro treated Season 2 on the Screaming Gaffers like a control puzzle: read the room, win when necessary, and keep danger pointed elsewhere. Ezekiel’s merge idol play protected him at the perfect moment and opened a runway into the endgame. He reached Final Tribal as the season’s most strategically-feared finalist, but finished runner-up to Duncan.\n\nReturning for Edge of Extinction (Season 4), Alejandro finally cashed in the crown after two straight runner-up finishes. Starting on Yellow → Red → Green → Campers, he navigated the swaps without losing his grip, then hit the endgame with back‑to‑back immunity wins (Episodes 7–8). His résumé was sealed at Final 4 with a fire‑making win over Gwen, and he survived the chaos of two public meltdowns (Episodes 10 and 14) long enough to reach Final Tribal Council. Result: Alejandro won Season 4.",

In Episode 12, Cameron chose the alliance over their unbreakable bond, and an idol/voided vote turned the margin into 4–1* vote (idol cancelled 1) (Result: voted out; 5th, 6th juror).\n\n Betrayed by unbreakable partner Cameron in S3. Wasted idol on Zoey in S4 Episode 1, leading to early elimination.\n\nIn Edge of Extinction (Season 4), Anne Maria delivered one of the most chaotic short runs imaginable. She found an idol—then spectacularly wasted it on Zoey in a round where Zoey received zero votes, turning a power moment into a punchline. Even after leaving, she still affected the game by sending an extra vote to Jo from the Edge. Result: Anne Maria finished 16th.",

He survived the early turbulence, but the merge format turned brutal: at the Episode 9 merge vote, a fractured field produced a 4–3–3–1 outcome—and Dwayne was the one name that stuck. Worse, he was later removed on Redemption Island by losing to Kitty and Emma (Result: merge boot, 4–3–3–1; 11th.)",

In the tightest finish of the season, Emma claimed the crown via a None in Episode 13 (Result: champion; 1st).\n\nComing in as a previous winner, Emma entered Edge of Extinction (Season 4) with a bullseye already painted. The tribe never gave her time to settle: she was cut in Episode 2 by a 5–3 vote as the cast chose safety over letting a champion breathe. Result: Emma finished 17th.\n\nPreviously seen in S3 and S4, Emma’s best finish before Blood vs. Water was 1th. On Blood vs. Water (Season 6), Emma entered with Kitty as the sister pair built for the merge—tight bond, clear reads, and a willingness to play hard when needed. She even grabbed the first merge immunity, but her season turned into a personal war: the Emma–Ryan feud kept poisoning coalition talks until the merge vote finally snapped into a deadlock. In Episode 10, Emma was the rock-draw casualty—one of the most brutal ‘the game doesn’t care’ exits of the franchise—and she was later finished off on Redemption. (Result: rocks → RI; 10th.)",

While louder duos burned trust and idols, he stayed ‘useful’—competent in challenges, calm in camp, and quietly steering the merge vote map by weaponizing other people’s feuds. He survived the season’s chaos points (tribe re-draw, Redemption returns, rock-draw fallout) and arrived at the end with the cleanest résumé left. In the finale, the jury didn’t debate—they crowned him in a 7–1–0 landslide. (Result: Season 6 champion, 1st.)",

PERFECT IDOL PLAY after holding for 9 tribals (franchise record). Runner-up in S3, third place in S4.\n\nScott came into Edge of Extinction (Season 4) as the franchise’s cleanest “toolbox” player—and proved it. He held an idol through nine consecutive Tribal Councils (a franchise record), then timed a perfect Final 5 play that cancelled three votes and kept his endgame intact. He even knocked out Cameron in a 2–0 decision, but at Final Tribal Council only Duncan rewarded the résumé. Result: Scott placed 3rd.",

Numbers back it up: 8 votes against. Signature beat: 8-4 vote. The run finally snapped when the numbers turned. (Result: Tyler out, Episode 2 — 8–4 vote.)",

      "story": "Debuting on Revenge of the Island (Season 3), Zoey was the social connector on the Mutant Maggots—liked by most, tied into multiple groups, and strong enough in challenges to stay relevant. Their run became defined by trust: the unbreakable bond with Scott carried them deep, even as the endgame turned into betrayal roulette. At the final vote before the Final Tribal Council, Scott pulled the trigger and Zoey was cut in Episode 13 (Result: voted out 3–1; 4th, final juror). Most socially connected player in franchise history.\n\nOn Edge of Extinction (Season 4), Zoey delivered a near‑perfect social game. She built an unprecedented web of three “unbreakable bonds” at once, kept her name off the parchment all season (the only vote against her was cancelled), and capped the midgame with a perfect idol play that erased seven votes and saved Geoff. After a key Episode 8 flip and back‑to‑back immunities late (Episodes 11–12), she reached Final Tribal Council—but fell just short. Result: Zoey finished runner‑up.",
